# Genetic-Shakespeare
This is a program based on Daniel Shiffman's Genetic Algorithm Demonstration "https://youtu.be/-jv3CgDN9sc"

Uses a Genetic Algorithm to emulate the "Infinite Monkey Theorem" "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem"

Usuing a traditional Brute-Force method, the program would have to iterate through 39^39 possible options to get the final result "TO BE OR NOT TO BE THAT OS THE QUESTION"

Instead, a series of array lists undergo an emulation of evolution, with fitness based on similiarity to the given string.
